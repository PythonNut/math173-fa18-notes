# MATH 173: Advanced Linear Algebra
Taught by: Professor Weiqing Gu, Harvey Mudd College, Fall 2018

I type all of these up in real time during lecture. 
As a result, I cannot record anything and my work will inevitably contains mistakes. 

If you see something wrong please let me know and I'll fix it.
If you have something that I missed, a PR would be appreciated.
